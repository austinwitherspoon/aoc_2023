These are written in either python, rust, or both. Each puzzle is set up as a command line tool (for different puzzle inputs) and has unit tests to verify answers are correct.

# Python versions
Python package uses poetry for the virtual environment and python 3.10.
Make sure you have poetry installed, and then run `poetry install` to setup the virtual environment.
All puzzles have pytests to confirm results.

# Rust versions
Rust versions live in the rust folder. These are also testable with cargo test.
